	<h2 align="center">1) Uploading data from files</h2>

	<h3 align="center">Supported file types</h3>
	<p>The following spreadsheet extensions are supported: .csv, .xls, .xlsx, .ods</p>

	<h3 align="center">Data formats for upload</h3>
	<p>Data in the the spreadsheet must be as follows:</p>
	<div>
		<b>Column names:</b>
		<p> required columns are:</p>
		<ul style="width:40%;">
			<li><b>"Name":</b> this is the only mandatory column, in absence of a Project_id, must be unique </li>
			<li> <b>"Project_id":</b> this column is not mandatory yet strongly adviced for the correct creation of new data and update of the existing ones </li>
			<li><b>"Start":</b> indicates the start date of the project/activity</li>
			<li><b>"End":</b> indicates the end date of the project/activity</li>
			<li><b>"Places":</b> a list of locations where the project/activity takes place, for the correct use of the application places must be written in a specific format (as described below)</li>
		</ul><br>
		<p>IMPORTANT: to uniquely identify a project, in case there is a "Project_id "column, its value will be used as identifier. Project_ids must be therefore unique. When importing data, existing data with the same Project_id will be overwritten (updated).</p>
		<p>If there is not a "Project_id" column, the mandatory "Name" column will replace it as identifier with the same characteristics described above.</p>
		<p>Project_ids (or Names) must be unique even between different datasets (but same User).</p><br>
		<p>Every column with a name different from the ones listed above will be automatically added with the indicated name.</p><br>
		<p>The "<b>Places</b>" column must be formatted as follows:</p>
		<p>The city names that indicate cities from the same country must be between curved brackets (even if there is only one city), followed by a comma and the country name, ending with a semicolon and eventually another list for different countries</p>
		<p><b>example: </b> (city1, city2, city3), country1; (city4), country2;</p><br>
		<p>In order to describe a whole country as location, write it in the file as follows:</p>
		<p> <b>example1: </b> (), country;</p>
		<p> <b>example2: </b> (city1, city2, , city3), country;*</p>
		<p> * there must be a space, an input like (city1, city2,, city3) is not valid.</p>

		<h2 align="center">2) Location formats</h2>
		<br><p>For correct operation of some graphs, Country names must be written in English, and in accordance with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">ISO 3166-1</a> standard. (e.g. "London, United Kingdom" or "Onolulu, United States")</p>
		<p>Different names may lead to malfunctions.</p>

		<h2 align="center">3) Timeline errors</h2>
		<br><p>The most common error in visualizing the timeline is often due to projects in which the end date comes before the start date.</p>
		<p>If this is not the case, it could be due to different date formats.</p>

		<h2 align="center">4) Marker Chart</h2>
		<br><p>The chart could sometimes take a while to be displayed.</p>
		<p>Clicking on markers will lead nowhere. Clicking on regions (countries) will zoom in to that country (after a while). Unfurtunately this will work well only with large countries.</p>
		<p>If all the projects of the dataset are in the same country, it will be zoomed in automatically.</p>
