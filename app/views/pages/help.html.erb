	<h2>1) Uploading data from files</h2>

	<h3>Supported file types</h3>
	<p>The following spreadsheet extensions are supported: .csv, .xls, .xlsx, .ods</p>

	<h3>Data formats for upload</h3>
	<p>Data in the the spreadsheet must be as follows:</p>
	<div>
		<b>Default column names:</b>
		<p> default columns are:</p>
		<ul style="width:40%;">
			<li><b>"Name":</b> this is the only mandatory column, in absence of a Project_id, must be unique. It indicates the name of the project. </li>
			<li> <b>"Project_id":</b> this column is not mandatory yet strongly adviced for the correct creation of new data and update of the existing ones. It identifies the project. </li>
			<li><b>"Start":</b> indicates the start date of the project/activity</li>
			<li><b>"End":</b> indicates the end date of the project/activity.</li>
			<li><b>"Places":</b> a list of locations where the project/activity takes place, for the correct use of the application places must be written in a specific format (as described below).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you want to customize your attribute names, you can do it right before starting the uploading.</p>
		<br>
		<p>IMPORTANT: to uniquely identify a project, in case there is a "Project_id "column, its value will be used as identifier. Project_ids must be therefore unique. When importing data, existing data with the same Project_id will be overwritten (updated).</p>
		<p>If there is not a "Project_id" column, the  "Name" column will replace it as identifier with the same characteristics described above.</p>
		<br>
		<p>If the importing process results in fewer data then expected, it could be due to shared project ids or project names between data.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Every column with a name that differs from the default ones (listed above) or the ones indicated before importing, will be automatically added with the indicated name.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The "<b>Places</b>" column works as a simple CSV (Comma Separated Values) list of places.</p>
		<p>IMPORTANT: every comma in this column will work as a separator between values.</p>
		<p>Examples:</p>
		<p>New York, Chicago, Boston, London, China, Australia, California, Scotland, Atlantic Ocean, North Pole, Mount Everest</p>

		<h2>2) Timeline errors</h2>
		<br><p>The most common error in visualizing the timeline is often due to projects in which the end date comes before the start date.</p>
		<p>If this is not the case, it could be due to different date formats.</p>

		<h2>3) Marker Chart</h2>
		<br><p>The chart could sometimes take a while to be displayed, or to display all markers.</p>
		<p>Clicking on markers will zoom in to the region where the marker is. Clicking on regions (countries) will zoom in to that country.</p>
		<p>If all the projects of the dataset are in the same country, it will be zoomed in automatically.</p>

		<h2>4) Embedding</h2>
		<br><p>Embeddable contents are: the simple map, the two timelines.</p>
		<p>To embed one, just go to the corresponding page once you opened the dataset (e.g. page "Map" or "Timeline").</p>
		<p>Under the object just press the "Embed" button, set the size you want (default is 800x400), and generate the embed code.</p>
		<p>You can copy and paste the embed code directly on your site.</p>
